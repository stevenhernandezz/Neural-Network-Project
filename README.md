# Neural-Network-Project
 This project focuses on a feedforward Neural Network using System Verilog, designed with both four-input and two-output configurations.
 
## Description 
 The neural network consists of thousands of processing nodes that are interconnected. Each neuron is grouped into 3 main layers which are:
 
 * Input Layer: Inputs are assigned initial weights which signify the importance of each input.
 * Hidden Layer: Processes inputs received from the previous layer with a set of weights and biases, and passes them through an activation function.
 * Output Layer: Produces the final output of the Neural Network after processing the inputs through the network layers.

 A feedforward Neural Network allows the data to flow from the input layer to the output layer without looping back. If the output from the activation function exceeds a specific threshold, it activates the neuron to pass the signal to the next layer.
